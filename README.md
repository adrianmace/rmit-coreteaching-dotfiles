Description
-----------

The following files are common files that I use on a regular basis on RMIT University's Coreteaching servers. 
They will set up your unix environment with a much more user friendly interface and includes some short-hand 
aliases to avoid typing repetitive, long commands. Your VIM text editor will also be configured with line 
numbers, syntax highlighting and will automatically drop text to new lines if they go over the 80 character 
limit imposed by many coding conventions taught at RMIT.

These servers are also known as Titan, Saturn, and Jupiter.

By downloading and installing these files you accept that I take no responsibility if your data is corrupted 
or damaged by this tool. It is designed to only make small changes to the files provided, however it is your 
responsibility to keep your files secured and backed up.

Installation
------------

Connect to one of the Coreteaching servers and paste the following command:

    curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adrianmace/rmit-coreteaching-dotfiles/master/install.sh | bash
